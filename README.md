# Budget
##Budget controlling program. A python learning project.

    THIS IS A TEST SCRIPT TO CONTROL MY BUDGET. THE IDEA IS TO CREATE 
    AN INTERACTIVE SCRIPT THAT TAKES INFORMATION FROM THE USER ABOUT
    EXPENSES WITH THE SAME INPUTS AS THE SPREADSHEET "BUDGET" ON MY
    GOOGLE DRIVE. 
    
    TO START I'LL HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO STORE THE INFORMATION
    THE IDEA IS TO HAVE THE PROGRAM OUTPUT A FEW THINGS:

    - A TABLE WITH INPUT, BALANCE, AND DISCRIMINATED USES OF MONEY
    - A GRAPH OF CURRENT, PAST, AND PROJECTIONS OF EXPENSES
    - SAVE INFORMATION IN A TEXT FILE THAT CAN BE UPLOADED TO THE 
      SCRIPT SO I DON'T HAVE TO RUN SEPARETLY FOR EVERY MONTH


    FUTURE FEATURES MIGHT INCLUDE:
